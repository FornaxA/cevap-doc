# Token  based data and identity management

One of the strengths of blockchain based systems is its capacity to provide transparancy and to manage trust trough encryption.

We will showcase two different means to demonstrate ownership: 1) control over a private key belonging to a blockchain address and 2) control over a GPG private key belonging to a public key. This is combined in an ecosystem comprising of a game studio, a game fan site and the blockchain, where a gamer can proof on a fan site (e.g. as part of a discussion forum) that he is a specific gamer (e.g., the winner of that week's tournament).

## Context

In two workshops, ProvenStack and students went through the basics of:
- Manual encoding, decoding and writing data on blockchain families based on the bitcoin core
- Setup and use a full developer environment for bitcoin core development
- Adding remote procedure calls to their blockchain clients
- Compile their modified clients

During this workshop, we will:
- Create and share a gpg key for encrypting, decrypting and signing messages
- Alpha test an utxo based token system for bitcoin families
- Link web technology to the blockchain
- Combine tokens with on-chain data to create new functionality
- Collaborate within a team using git and github
